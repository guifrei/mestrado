\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
  \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
\else
  % normal IEEE
  \usepackage{cite}
\fi
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later.





% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}

% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:

%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated

% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a sans serif font rather
% than the serif font used in traditional IEEE formatting and thus the need
% to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending on whether
% compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}

If heat transfer takes place through a common boundary between two bodies in physical contact, a discontinuity in the temperature profile is observed across the interface defined by that boundary, which indicates that the thermal contact is not perfect there. The ratio of the heat flux per area unit to the temperature drop, both measured at that interface, is called \textit{thermal contact conductance} (abbreviated as TCC):

\begin{equation}
h_c = \frac{q_c}{\Delta T} \label{definicao_1}
\end{equation}

An equivalent definition of the TCC may be established upon the analysis of the associated heat conduction problem, by means of the boundary conditions evaluated on the contact interface. Thus, if $T_1$ and $T_2$ are the temperature fields in each of the solids whose contact interface is designated by $\Gamma$, and  $k_1$ and $k_2$ are their respective thermal conductivities, then energy balance allows the following relation:

\begin{equation}
-k_1\frac{\partial T_1}{\partial \mathbf{n}_1}\bigg|_\Gamma
=
h_c(T_1 - T_2)_\Gamma
=
k_2\frac{\partial T_2}{\partial \mathbf{n}_2}\bigg|_\Gamma \label{definicao_2}
\end{equation}

which leads to

\begin{equation}
h_c = \frac{-k_1\displaystyle\frac{\partial T_1}{\partial \mathbf{n}_1}\bigg|_\Gamma}{(T_1 - T_2)_\Gamma} = \frac{k_2\displaystyle\frac{\partial T_2}{\partial \mathbf{n}_2}\bigg|_\Gamma}{(T_1 - T_2)_\Gamma} \label{eq:definicao_3}
\end{equation}

The TCC may be seen as a parameter to evaluate the quality of the contact between two solid bodies. In extreme cases, for instance, the TCC vanishes on perfect thermally isolated regions along the contact interface, since the heat flux on the numerator in \eqref{definicao_1} will be zero, whereas an infinite value for TCC will be found where the contact itself is perfect, for which the temperature jump on the denominator in \eqref{definicao_1} will be zero. The TCC may also be useful for evaluating the presence of discontinuities or cracks inside heterogeneous materials; in fact, there will be temperature jumps at those regions and the temperature fields measured on the external boundaries of the material will show values different from the expected ones if those discontinuities did not exist. Some examples of the necessity of calculating or estimating the TCC may be found in aerodynamics (citar LAMBERT), microelectronics (citar SNAITH) or heat exchanger projects (citar HUANG). 

Because of its special features, the problem of estimation of the TCC may be classified as an Inverse Heat Conduction Problem (abbreviated as IHCP). In this case, the TCC works as an unknown function to be estimated across the contact interface, by employing, for instance, temperature and heat flux measures at the boundaries of the problem domain composed by the bodies in contact.

Measuring methods for estimating the TCC usually demand knowlegde of details of the surfaces in contact, as well as evaluations of temperature and heat flux inside the bodies in contact, resulting in complex or intrusive experimental assemblies. Still, indirect evaluation of temperature jumps and heat flux distributions across contact interfaces has been the object of recent researches, leading to development of more computationally efficient estimation techniques for the TCC (citar os trabalhos pg 4). However, these techniques have been applied to regular geometrical configurations, such as plane or circular-shaped cross section contact interfaces.

Primary text headings should be in Arial, 10-point size, boldface, in capital letters and flush left with the left margin. If the heading runs for more than one line, the run-over text should also be flush left with the left margin. There should be one line space above primary headings. Text begins on the line following the heading.


\textbf{FIGURES}

Figures must be embedded in your text and appear as close as possible to its first reference. All figures (graphs, line drawings, photographs, etc.) should be numbered consecutively and have a caption consisting of the figure number and a brief title. This number should be used when referring to the figure in the text. All figures should be referenced in the text. The caption should be placed under the figure and both figure and caption should be centered. There should be a minimum of one empty line above the figure and between figure caption and the text (see Fig. 1 as an example).
